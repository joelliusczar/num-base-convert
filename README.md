num-base-convert
================

This converts numbers between different bases and does various programming mathematical function.
This needs to be rewritten because it is in awfully written but it's not important enought to warrent being rewritten.

This program is purely for fun. I know that there are already programs that do the same thing this program does
but in an even more efficient way. The program works by using a ton and string and array manipulation. I imagine that 
there are ways to get the same results that tap right into the computer's assemblies which I assume is the fastest way to 
accomplish it.
