num-base-convert
================

This is a c# program that converts numbers between different bases and does various programming mathematical function.
Right now, I am basically rewriting the entire program because I don't particully like the way that I wrote it the first 
time. The problem with the old version is that it will probably break in a huge way if anybody ever tries to update it.

There is no real point to this program. I know that there are already programs that do the same thing this program does
but in an even more efficient way. The program works by using a ton and string and array manipulation. I imagine that 
there are ways to get the same results that tap right into the computer's assemblies which I assume is the fastest way to 
accomplish it.
